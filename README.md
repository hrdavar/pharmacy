To build a pharmacy sales and management system, there are several key areas and features to consider. These include inventory management, sales, customer management, and reporting. Here’s a breakdown of these important aspects:

1. Drug Management:

Inventory and Stock Management: The system should allow tracking of stock levels, including entries and exits, displaying current stock, and alerting when stocks are low or when drugs are nearing expiration.

Drug Information Registration: Detailed information about each drug, such as name, manufacturer, dosage, and ingredients, should be stored.

Expiration Date Control: Alerts for drugs that are nearing expiration to remove them from shelves in a timely manner.



2. Sales and Invoicing:

Sales Invoice Generation: Capability to generate printed or digital invoices, select items from inventory, and calculate costs.

Discount and Promotional Management: Options for applying discounts or special sales offers for specific drugs or customer groups.

Payment Management: The ability to record different payment methods (cash, credit card, etc.) and track customer payments.



3. Customer Management:

Customer Information Registration: A database to store customer information, including personal details, purchase history, and prescribed drugs.

Loyalty Programs: Create loyalty programs and offer discounts or points to reward loyal customers.



4. Reporting and Analytics:

Financial Reports: Provide financial reports, such as daily, weekly, and monthly sales, profit, and loss.

Inventory Reports: Reports on stock levels, expiration dates, and items that need to be reordered.

Performance Reports: Evaluate staff performance and analyze sales and inventory data to improve pharmacy services.



5. Prescription and Dispensing Management:

Prescription Management: Record and manage customer prescriptions and dispense medication based on prescriptions from physicians.

Insurance Coordination: If the pharmacy collaborates with health insurance providers, the system should manage insurance information and settlements.



6. Security and Access Control:

User Access Levels: Define different access levels for staff (such as cashier, stock manager, and pharmacy manager) to prevent unauthorized access.

Data Backup and Security: Regular data backups and protection of sensitive customer information.




These features can help you build a complete and efficient system for managing a pharmacy.
